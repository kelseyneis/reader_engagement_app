                <h1>Reader engagement survey</h1>
                <p>
                    In this study, we are trying to endow machines with an understanding
                    of what makes a story good, because nobody likes a future where AI
                    has bad taste :). So, as you're reading, if you enjoy the story, please
                    keep in the back of your mind the question, "what do I like about it and
                    why do I want to read more?" In the short term, this feedback will help
                    train a system to identify engaging stories and what makes
                    them engaging. If you don't like the story, that's ok. Feel free to skim it
                    and give feedback about what you didn't like.
                </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Login here by entering your name:
                            <b><Link className="nav-link" to="/login">Login</Link></b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choose a story below to read. Please read the first page, then answer the questions
                            on the next page. After that, read the rest of the story and answer the questions
                            at the end.
                        </li>

                            Then you'll go back and read the story again. This time, highlight areas that made you:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Confused</li>
                                <li>Connected to or empathetic with a character</li>
                                <li>Transported to the scene of the story</li>
                                <li>Curious about the writer's intentions or about what will happen next</li>
                                <li>Other. You enjoyed it but don't know why</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                <h2>Highlighting Practice</h2>
                <p>To highlight a passage, first select the category you want to label it using the dropdown
                    below. Then, drag your mouse over the text to highlight it. You can highlight multiple
                    categories in one paragraph by repeating those steps. If you make a mistake, just click
                    on the highlighted area, and it will remove the highlight. Give it a try!</p>
