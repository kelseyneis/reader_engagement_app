            <ol>
               <li>Confused</li>

            <h2>Highlighting Practice</h2>
            <p>To highlight a passage, first select the category you want to label it using the dropdown
               below. Then, drag your mouse over the text to highlight it. You can highlight multiple
               categories in one paragraph by repeating those steps. If you make a mistake, just click
               on the highlighted area, and it will remove the highlight. Give it a try!</p>
            <p><em>Note: due to a bug in the app, highlighting over an existing highlight will break the UI. Try not to overlap highlights.</em></p>
