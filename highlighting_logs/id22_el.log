I can't blame it for advancing the plot so rapidly and ending so abruptly given the shortness of the story, but I can say that within such a short period it tended to overuse the words which it used to describe the main characters. A bit more variation in how the woman was described would have gone a long way in terms of humanizing the main character, though it could be said that repetition is a sign of a sort of obsession, fixating on singular characteristics to the detriment of others. Broadly, the story was an alright read which articulated a pretty common situation which a person may find themselves in but it failed in attempting to bring the story and the characters to life due to its stilted writing and short run time."}
