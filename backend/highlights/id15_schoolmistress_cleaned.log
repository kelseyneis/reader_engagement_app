For thirteen years she had been schoolmistress, and there was no reckoning how many times during all those years she had been to the town for her salary; and whether it were spring as now, or a rainy autumn evening, or winter, it was all the same to her, and she always\u2014invariably\u2014longed for one thing only, to get to the end of her journey as quickly as could be.", "tag": "Present", "color": "#0072B2"}]
